PAM8403 amplifier module
========================

The PAM8403 is a compact amplifier module to drive small speakers.

It comes in various variants, some include a potentiometer to control the volume. This is the recommended variant for
this project.

## Wiring and Configuration

The module usually uses 5 V. Two speakers can be connected.

| PAM8403 Pin | Raspberry Pi/Speaker Pin |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Power -     | Pi GND                   |
| Power +     | Pi VCC (5 V)             |
| Lout -      | Left Speaker GND         |
| Lout +      | Left Speaker Signal      |
| Rout -      | Right Speaker GND        |
| Rout +      | Right Speaker Signal     |
| L           | *see below*              |
| G           | *see below*              |
| R           | *see below*              |

The input can be connected in two ways:

---

### A: via 3.5 mm audio jack

Most boards (first to fourth generation inclusively) provide an audio jack for headphones. We can use this to connect
the signal to the amplifier. You can check out the
[Raspberry Pi Documentation](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/develop/documentation/asciidoc/computers/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-schematics.adoc)
for schematics. Most boards provide names checkpoints for audio that can be used to solder a connection to.

For Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 boards (probably also Pi 1, but it is not referenced in the schematics):

| PAM8403 Pin | Raspberry Pi Checkpoint |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| L           | PP25                    |
| G           | PP6                     |
| R           | PP26                    |

For Raspberry Pi 4 boards:

| PAM8403 Pin | Raspberry Pi Checkpoint |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| L           | TP22                    |
| G           | TP7/TP8/TP9/TP12        |
| R           | TP23                    |

Raspberry Pi 5 (and probably onwards) and Zero Boards do not provide an audio jack. They can use the next variant.

### B: via GPIO pins

GPIO pins can be configured to output audio signals. To enable this, add this to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:

```
dtoverlay=pwm-2chan,pin=18,func=2,pin2=19,func2=2
```

The input can then be wired as follows:

| PAM8403 Pin | Raspberry Pi Pin |
|-------------|------------------|
| L           | GPIO 18          |
| G           | GND              |
| R           | GPIO 19          |

---

To test it out, get some audio files and try to play them from the command line. You can use `aplay`, which is
preinstalled, to play `.wav` files. For `.mp3` files, you can use `mpg123`, which has to be installed separately.
