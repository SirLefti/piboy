![image](docs/prototype2/proto2_final.jpg)
Build your own Pip-Boy with some useful features for real-life using your Raspberry Pi.

## Features

#### File Manager App
Provides basic functions for moving, copying and deleting files and directories. Plug in a USB drive as a holo tape.

![inv](docs/apps/inv.png)

#### System App
Can fetch and install updates from the git repository.

![sys](docs/apps/sys.png)

#### Environment App
Provides useful information about your environment like temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity.

![env](docs/apps/env.png)

#### Radio App
Actually more like a classic music player. Stay tuned!

![rad](docs/apps/rad.png)

#### Debug App
Shows the last pressed key to help you check the key wiring.

![dbg](docs/apps/dbg.png)

#### Clock App
It just shows the time on a classic analog clock.

![clk](docs/apps/clk.png)

#### Map App
Supports zooming and moving the map around. Don't get lost in the wasteland.

## Hardware

Base:
- Raspberry Pi (full size board with all 40 pins recommended)
- 3.5" SPI display module (with an ILI9486 display driver chip)
- rotary encoder module (KY-040)
- 6x micro push buttons (6 mm x 6 mm)
- perf board/proto board (14x9 holes required)
- wires, general soldering stuff
- rotary encoder knob (optional, choose one you like)
- USB Wi-Fi adapter (optional, if your Pi does not have Wi-Fi onboard)

Modules:
- BME280 environment sensor
- NEO-6M GPS module
- DS3231 RTC clock (optional, but recommended)
- ADS1115 analog-digital converter

Audio:
- PAM8403 amplifier with potentiometer
- 2x Mini Speakers (e.g. Loudity 16 mm or Adafruit Oval 20 mm x 30 mm)
- capacitor ~1000 ÂµF, 25 V (optional, but recommended to stabilize power when turning on the PAM8403)
- potentiometer knob (optional, choose one you like)

Battery power:
- MT3608 power converter
- TP4056 battery charging controller
- 18650 battery cell (others can fit as well)
- toggle switch

Additional parts depending on case version.

> **NOTE:**<br>
> Prototype 1 does not support modules, audio and battery power internally.

> **NOTE:**<br>
> Prototype 2 supports BME280, NEO-6M, DS3231 and battery power. ADS1115 can be squeezed in as well, but there is no
> documentation. Audio is not supported internally

## Installation

All guides are using Raspberry OS based on Debian Bookworm.

Install system dependencies:
````bash
sudo apt install git libopenjp2-7 libportaudio2 libopenblas0 python3-rpi-lgpio fonts-freefont-ttf
````

Call `sudo raspi-config`, select `Interface Options > SPI` and choose `Yes` to enable SPI.
Then select `Interface Options > I2C` and choose `Yes` to enable I2C.
Then also select `Interface Options > Serial Port` and choose `No` in the first pop-up and `Yes` in the second
pop-up. The last pop-up should then inform you, that the serial login shell is disabled and the serial interface is
enabled.

Clone repository and go into it:
````bash
git clone https://github.com/SirLefti/piboy
cd piboy
````

Create a virtual environment:
````bash
python -m venv .venv
````

Install python dependencies:
````bash
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-pi.txt
````

Create a systemd service in ``/etc/systemd/system/piboy.service``:
````ini
[Unit]
Description=PiBoy Python Script
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/piboy
ExecStart=/home/pi/piboy/.venv/bin/python -u /home/pi/piboy/piboy.py
StandardOutput=file:/home/pi/piboy/log
StandardError=file:/home/pi/piboy/err
Restart=on-failure
User=pi
Group=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
````

Reload to get the new configuration:
````bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
````

Activate the new service:
````bash
sudo systemctl enable piboy.service
````

Either restart the Pi or start the service manually:
````bash
sudo systemctl start piboy.service
````

> **NOTE:**<br>
> Please refer to the module specific instructions for additional steps to make everything work.

## Configuration

On first run, the PiBoy script will create a ``config.yaml`` if not found. In that config file, you can configure
everything that relates to appearance and wiring. When running on a Raspberry Pi, ``dev_move`` must be set to ``false``
if not set by default. For development, it must be set to ``true`` instead, obviously. This setting automatically loads
the right input and display modules. On a Raspberry Pi, ``ILI9486Display`` and ``GPIOInput`` are being used. For
development, ``TkInteraction`` or ``SelfManagedTkInteraction`` can be used, both implement full input and display
functionality.

You can define additional color groups under ``app_config/modes`` for your own theme and set the index at
``app_config/color_mode``. The first default color group is the traditional classic green theme, the second is a yellow
power armor theme.

This project uses FreeSansBold as default font. If the font cannot be found despite being installed, or you do not want
to install it, place the ``FreeSansBold.ttf`` in the root directory as a workaround.

## Assembly

See [instructions for prototype 1](docs/prototype1/ASSEMBLY.md).

See [instructions for prototype 2](docs/prototype2/ASSEMBLY.md).

### Module specific instructions

* [BME280 environmental sensor](./docs/BME280.md)
* [DS3231 RTC clock](./docs/DS3231.md)
* [NEO-6M GPS module](./docs/NEO-6M.md)
* [ADS1115 analog-digital converter](./docs/ADS1115.md)
* [KY-040 rotary encoder](./docs/rotary-encoder.md)
* [Keypad](./docs/keypad.md)

## Post-Install

### Wi-Fi connection

You might want to add another Wi-Fi connection, e.g. to your phone, when you are out of your homes Wi-Fi range. Get in
the range of the Wi-Fi you want to add and check, if your device can see it:
````bash
nmcli dev wifi
````
If your Wi-Fi is not found immediately, wait a bit and run the command again.

If it was found, you can configure the connection (replace `<wifi-ssid>` and `<wifi-password>`):
````bash
sudo nmcli dev wifi connect <wifi-ssid> password <wifi-password>
````
When you were connected via `ssh`, the connection might reset due to the network change.

Network configurations are saved at `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`. Refer to the documentation of `nmcli` for
further details.

## Roadmap

* [ ] auto-mount usb drives (previous solution does not work any more)
* [ ] other apps (?)
* [ ] battery status (?)
* [ ] improved case
* [ ] utilities

## Issues

### PyAudio

`pyaudio` might require system dependencies to be installed. On macOS, install the `portaudio` dependency with MacPorts:
```bash
sudo port install portaudio
```
Then install the package with pip and pass the directories where to find the dependencies:
```bash
CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include -L/opt/local/lib" .venv/bin/pip install pyaudio
```
